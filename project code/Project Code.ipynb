        "This project aims to develop an AI model for allergen detection in food products using a multi-label classification approach. It will utilize a Random Forest classifier which will be used for multi-label classification to predict the presence or absence of allergens in food products. This project addresses the limitations of traditional allergen detection methods, ensuring consumer safety and improving food allergen detection accuracy and food quality control processes. Using the \"Food Ingredients and Allergens\" dataset from Kaggle, the model will be trained to predict the presence of allergenic ingredients in different food products. The model will learn how to recognize patterns and associations between ingredients and allergens. The developed model will then be integrated into a web application for user-friendly allergen detection, where people with allergies can make informed decisions about the food they buy and consume. This project has the potential to benefit food manufacturers, the food service industry, regulatory bodies, and people with allergies, ultimately improving food safety and promoting informed food choices."

It is a combination of one or more hierarchical predictive models called decision trees, yielding the modal class as the output for the classification task (Pillai & Malhotra, 2020).

Most notably is the the presence/absence of the `Allergens_none` feature being the most important factor for determining the predictions in the food allergen detection system, with  the highest importance score. This suggests that whether a food product is labelled to contain any allergens or not has a significant impact on the classification outcome.\n",
