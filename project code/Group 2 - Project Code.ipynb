        "This project aims to develop an AI model for allergen detection in food products using a multi-label classification approach. It will utilize separate Random Forest classifiers for each allergen class, treating them as independent binary classification tasks. This project addresses the limitations of traditional allergen detection methods, ensuring consumer safety and improving food allergen detection accuracy and food quality control processes. Using the \"Food Ingredients and Allergens\" dataset from Kaggle, the model will be trained to predict the presence of allergenic ingredients in different food products. The model will learn how to recognize patterns and associations between ingredients and allergens. The developed model will then be integrated into a web application for user-friendly allergen detection, where people with allergies can make informed decisions about the food they buy and consume. This project has the potential to benefit food manufacturers, the food service industry, regulatory bodies, and people with allergies, ultimately improving food safety and promoting informed food choices."

        "The `roc_curve` function computes the false positive rate (FPR), true positive rate (TPR), and thresholds based on the predicted probabilities and the true labels (y_test). The `auc` function calculates the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Finally, the ROC curve is plotted using `matplotlib.pyplot`, displaying the AUC value and the diagonal reference line representing random guessing.\n",

        "Moreover, the Medley model's initial value is lower compared to our model indicates that at a lower threshold, the Medley model captures a significant amount of False Positives compared to the True Positives. However, the increase in the threshold made the model more conservative in classifying positives, and thus led to the rise in value indicating less False Positives (lower FPR) yet still capturing True Positives (higher TPR) at a consistent rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the AUC value of our Model is shown to be higher than the Medley model, indicating that our model has a **better classification performance** than the latter model. This means that our model distinguishes the positives and the negatives better compared to the Medley model."

However, we can still observe a decline in the precision of Medley's model  once the value of recall gets closer to `1.0`. On the other hand, the precision of our model is consistent until it reaches the highest recall value."

Most notably is the the presence/absence of the `Allergens_none` feature being the **most important factor** for determining the predictions in the food allergen detection system, with the highest importance score. This suggests that **whether a food product is labelled to contain any allergens or not has a significant impact on the classification outcome.**\n",
