# AI for AI

This project aims to develop an AI model for allergen detection in food products using a multi-label classification approach.

# AI.llergen

The deployed web app, named AI.llergen, lets the user input the food product and its details (such as main ingredient, sweetener, allergen, etc) in order to find out whether the food product contains allergens or not. The AI model we trained will be used for predicting the presence of allergens.
